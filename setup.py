"""The one thing pyproject.toml cannot say: which modules of a package go in the wheel.

A verification ships the local app, the gate, orchestrator, replay harness, visual observer and its model clients.
Repair includes its fixer and sandbox. The demo loop stays out. A verification reads its vision key only from the
environment. tests/test_package.py checks the wheel's complete import chain.

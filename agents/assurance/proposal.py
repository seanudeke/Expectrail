"""Turn a candidate fix into an OBAAF proposal bundle, and check it with OBAAF.

A candidate is a game-relative unified diff made against the seeded game (``player/player.tscn``),
applied with ``patch -p1`` inside ``game/platformer``. OBAAF's proposal checker wants a Git diff
relative to the repository root (``game/platformer/player/player.tscn``), and it is right to: the
path it checks is the path a pull request would change. Rewriting the patch's headers would be
guessing. Instead this materializes the base, a disposable repository cloned from this
repository's committed HEAD with the seeded defect committed on top, applies the candidate to a
second clone of that base, and asks Git for the diff (``git diff --no-renames``). Nothing here runs
game code: patches are applied to files, never replayed.

Two rule sets apply, and both must pass:

- OBAAF's (``obaaf proposal check --repo``): no workflow, instruction or OBAAF file, no symlink or
  submodule, no rename, at most 100 paths and 1,000,000 bytes, applied again to a temporary index of
  the base. ``PROTECT`` adds Expectrail's own trust boundary to its protected paths: the verifier,
  harness, evaluator, contracts, specs, tests, benchmarks and seeded bugs.
- Expectrail's (``editable``): every changed path must sit under the game root and match the
  request's editable globs. OBAAF's list says what may never change; this one says what may.

The bundle holds only ``patch.diff`` and ``meta.json`` (untrusted notes, never acted on). The
verification report, frames and records are separate artifacts: OBAAF refuses any other file in a
bundle, and evidence must not travel inside the thing it is evidence about.

    python3 -m agents.assurance.proposal --seed bugs/physics-fall-through/v1.patch \\
        --candidate agents/fixtures/fix-collision-mask.patch --out runs/proposal

needs ``obaaf`` on PATH (or ``OBAAF_BIN``), installed from the reviewed revision in ``OBAAF_REVISION``.

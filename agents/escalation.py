"""Report first, evidence on rejection: what the fixer is told on each attempt.

The decision and its evidence are in docs/report-first.md. In short: Muse Code fixes these bugs as
well from a plain report as from Expectrail's evidence (45 of 46 live cases on the first attempt),
and the verifier, not the briefing, is what stops a fix that only looks right. So:

- **Attempt 1, the report:** the failing check's one sentence in plain English, screenshots of the
  failing run spaced from its first frame to its last, the route and the run's log. No spec, no
  verdict, no evidence.
- **After an attempt fails, the evidence:** the repair request (the approved spec, the evaluator's
  verdict on the failing run and its first failing frame) and, after a rejection, the verifier's
  reasons limited to the public checks. A held-out route, a guard, or the reason one failed never
  reaches the fixer, so it cannot be fixed to the test. An attempt fails when the verifier rejects
  it or when it produces no fix (it timed out or changed nothing): on October 31, report-only
  attempts on both sinking bugs timed out three times in a row while the evidence fixed each on
  the first attempt (Fix matrix run 41223754703).
- **Every candidate is verified,** whatever the fixer was told. The fixer never decides it is done.

``EXPECTRAIL_BRIEFING=evidence`` restores the previous behaviour (the evidence from attempt 1).

"""The ``expectrail`` command: one name in front of what is built.

    expectrail verify --head . --game game/platformer --routes 'routes/*.json' --specs specs [--base ../base]
    expectrail status JOB | cancel JOB | report JOB
    expectrail sample              three real verifications of the bundled game: as it is, broken, repaired
    expectrail doctor [--json]     does this machine have what a verification needs?
    expectrail --version

`verify`, `status`, `cancel`, `report` and `sample` are the orchestrator's own commands
(``expectrail.orchestrator.cli``): the same functions, the same options and the same exit codes as
``python3 -m expectrail.orchestrator``. Nothing is implemented twice here.

`doctor` is ``expectrail.doctor``: it checks the machine, exits 0 or 3, and is not a verdict.

Commands that are planned and not built say so, name the issue, and exit 5 (the command could not
be carried out). They never print a verdict. A command line that cannot be read (a missing or
unknown option) exits 5 too, never 2: 2 is needs-review.

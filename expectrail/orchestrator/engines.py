"""What runs a job's verification, per adapter. An engine verifies; none of them starts a fixer or
reads saved data in place of a run.

The engines are picked through the adapter registry (``harness.adapters``): ``ENGINES`` has one for
every registered adapter that has a verify path (``verify_run``), and no other. A request that names
an adapter the registry does not hold, or one with no verify path, completes as needs-review with
``INPUT_INVALID`` and nothing runs.

An engine has two parts:

- ``preflight(request)`` returns the diagnostics that stop the job before anything runs (a missing
  tool, a project that is not there). The job then completes as needs-review, never as a pass.
- ``execute(request, paths, advance)`` runs the verification, writes its evidence into
  ``paths.staging`` and returns a Result. It may call ``advance(phase)`` as it moves on.
